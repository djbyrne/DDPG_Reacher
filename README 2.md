# DDPG Reacher

### Introduction

This experiment implements the DDPG algorithm to train a mechanical arm to reach for a moving target inside the unity ML-Agents virtual environment[Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher)environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Solving the Environment
The environment is considered solved when the average score of all agents in the environment (in this case 20) for a period of 100 episodes is 30 or above.

### Setup

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

2. Place the file in the project directory and change the environment path in the notebook

### Instructions

All code for this project is contained in the jupyter notebook. As such you just need to run the cells in order to see the results.
